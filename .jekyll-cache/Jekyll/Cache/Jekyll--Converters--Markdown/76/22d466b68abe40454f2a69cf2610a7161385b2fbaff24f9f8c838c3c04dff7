I"<p>In class, we practiced interviewing through an exercise about hobbies.
I was being interviewed, and because I was not comfortable with my interviewer,
I decided to make up a persona to impersonate.
My personaâ€™s hobby was riding a Razor scooter.
Understandably, this activity was quite foreign to my interviewer, and it took him a while to understand what my hobby entailed.</p>
