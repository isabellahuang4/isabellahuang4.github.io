I"ˆ<p>In class, we practiced interviewing through an exercise about hobbies.
I was being interviewed, and because I was not comfortable with my interviewer,
I decided to make up a persona to impersonate.
My persona‚Äôs hobby was riding a Razor scooter.
Understandably, this activity was quite foreign to my interviewer, and it took him a while to understand what my hobby entailed.</p>

<p>The questions that were most helpful in elucidating this hobby, from the perspective
of the interviewee, included ones of the type:
‚ÄúDescribe to me one time that you (did this activity).‚Äù
For the interviewee, this allows them to speak specifically.
Otherwise, the natural mode is to generalize, and through generalizations, it is
hard to elicit a clear picture.</p>
