I"£<p>On Monday, we talked about some products that were frustrating to use and some products that were pleasing to use. 
One item that stood out as very frustrating was the bike rack, which does not fully account for variations in shape, size, and design of a bicycle, leading to reduced ease of accedds to lock the bike, reduced manueverability and stability, and potentially damage to the bikes locked at the rack.</p>
