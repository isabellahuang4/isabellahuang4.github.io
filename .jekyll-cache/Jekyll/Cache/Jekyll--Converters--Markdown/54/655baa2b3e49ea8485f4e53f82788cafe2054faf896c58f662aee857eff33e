I"5<p>I first picked the paper by Oulasvirta et al. “Interaction in 4-second Bursts: the Fragmented Nature of Attentional Resource in Mobile HCI.”
It sparked my interest, because I had previously taken a class called “Distraction,” and have since been intrigued with regards to how our modes of attention and distraction are shaped by artefacts around us.
In the paper, Oulasvirta et al. propose a new theoretical framework (i.e. a theoretical contribution to the field) and empirically test the predictive validity of the framework through a field study.</p>
