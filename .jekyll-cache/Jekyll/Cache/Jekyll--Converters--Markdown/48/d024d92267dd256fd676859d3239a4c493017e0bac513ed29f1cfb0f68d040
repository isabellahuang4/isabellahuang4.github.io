My general research interests include embodied cognition, language, and education.
I am a member of the NSF funded TalkBack project, working to provide K12 mathematics teachers 
automatic feedback to better help facilitate equitable classroom dialogues. 
I am also a graduate student member of the Computer Science departmentâ€™s Graduate Committee as well as an officer on CSGSA (Graduate Student Association).
