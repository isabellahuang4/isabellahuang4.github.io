I"(<p>We designed two cultural probes for our project. 
Our project has two different dimensions: physical location and emotional location.
For the matter of physical location integrated with community, we thought asking our participants
to draw their own understanding of their physical community through a map
would elucidate their relationships with physical space and landmarks.
Furthermore, asking them to envision both their day and their friendsâ€™ days
as integrated within the sketch would conduct an exercise of situating
their experiences.</p>
