I"’<p>It seems that Li et alâ€™s Topiary tool would be especially apt for use in our project, 
given that we are seeking to develop an app that puts location of self and others 
at the forefront.
It would afford us a Wizard of Oz tool to simulate location updates during user testing.
We could use data collected through the cultural probes (i.e. hand-drawn maps) 
to develop the back-end of Topiary.</p>
