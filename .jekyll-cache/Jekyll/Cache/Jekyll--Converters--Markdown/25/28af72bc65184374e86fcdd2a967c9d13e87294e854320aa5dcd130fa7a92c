I"Ì<p>On Monday as a small group, we discussed personas with respect to Googleâ€™s Cardboard VR headset.
We approached the task through reverse-engineering, brainstorming different use cases that we knew of or that we could envision.
We did generate use cases that were pretty traditional for virtual reality in general, such as video games and sharing of experiences. 
However, we sought to focus on those that were particularly suited for Google Cardboard.</p>
