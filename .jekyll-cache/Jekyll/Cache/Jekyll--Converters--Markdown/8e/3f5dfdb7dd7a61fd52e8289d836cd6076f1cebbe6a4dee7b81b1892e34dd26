I";<p>My everyday task will be making coffee (because a mathematician’s job
is turning coffee into theorems).
I do this every morning as a coffee nerd does:</p>

<p>first: weighing out the beans (requires a scale)</p>

<p>second: grinding the beans</p>

<p>third: heating the water (requires a kettle)</p>

<p>fourth: mixing grounds with water (I’ll skip the intricacies of this “step”)</p>

<p>In weighing out the beans, the gulf of execution is small.
It is pretty clear through simple trial and error that when you put something
on the scale, the scale display will change accordingly.
However, the gulf of evaluation is large. 
Depending on the quality of the scale, there will be a lag between when
things are set on scale and when the scale updates.
This lag contributes to the ability to answer the question of whether one has
put enough beans on the scale, i.e. whether one has executed this 
step fully!
Moreover, the buttons of the particular scale I use lack tactile feedback,
thereby increasing the gulf of evaluation.
It is immediately unclear whether I have truly pressed the button to tare the scale or 
to turn off the scale – which turns out to be the same button.
I have to wait for at least 2 seconds to determine whether I have “done the thing”.</p>

<p>For these issues with the scale, I would refer to the heuristic of “visibility
of system status”. 
Indeed, much of the problems identified ask the question of
when the system “understood” the input of the user – 
in other words, when the status of the system updated with respect to 
user input.</p>
