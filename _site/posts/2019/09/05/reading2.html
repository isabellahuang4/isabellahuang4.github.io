    <p>The Inmates are Running the Asylum – Chapter 9, Personas</p>

<p>Cooper states that “I am shooting for believability, not diversity,” in arguing that in designing for a computer technician, one should imagine a (presumably) white, geeky male as opposed to a woman who is physically attractive and tall. 
This is problematic in many ways, one of which is perpetuating stereotypes that are harmful and replicate systems of oppression. 
In creating and imagining a persona, Cooper has succesfully argued that one should be precise. 
However, the type of details with which one is precise matters.
One should not be making caustic assumptions regarding demographics of your “users” that are not important. 
If we are designing for a computer technician, it does not matter whether they used to be the president of the AV club in high school or they were the prom king/queen (which should be noted are not mutually exclusive).
Nor does it matter how physically attractive they are.
What matters is how their position as a computer technician influences the way that they will interact with the product.</p>

<p>In creating personas for my research project, I aimed to keep all descriptions gender-neutral, making sure I used they/them pronouns and giving each persona a gender-neutral name.
In doing so, I was able to ensure that no biases about teachers and mathematics regarding gender would creep into our work, which is especially important given that we are seeking to create – at the heart of our research – an equitable classroom setting. 
Furthermore, by not focusing on irrelevant aspects, we were able to drill down to the core issues with which our personas were concerned.</p>

<p>Task Analysis</p>

<p>Upon first glance, it seems that what one does in task decomposition is more or less what is meant by those in the realm of education when they refer to “computational thinking.”
That is, task analysis is the core of what it means to think like a computer scientist – breaking down complex tasks into subroutines and useful abstractions.
In fact, in our CS education seminar, we used the precise task of cleaning a room to illustrate this understanding of computational thinking.
However, a question we should ask is when this type of thinking is beneficial when introduced. 
As seen in the “make tea” example, such a decomposition may be more complicated than the task itself warrants.
Thus, in teaching computational thinking and in using task analysis, we should also consider the merits of deploying such an analytical framework and the scope of the analysis.</p>

<p>As a simple example and connection, the entity-relationship approach to modeling is used in some natural language processing systems, but not all. 
Indeed, when the structure of the domain is ripe and strict – such as a chatbot travel agent – it simplifies the task to highlight these relationships and categorize entities as such. 
However, not all NLP systems use such a classfication, because not all domains are structured in such a way that affords a easy and usable decomposition.</p>

<p>Sample Task Analysis: TalkBack Application</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Teacher records class</p>

    <p>i. Teacher sets up Swivl stand, Swivl markers, and iPad</p>

    <p>ii. Teacher hits record on iPad</p>

    <p>iii. Teacher names and saves recording</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Upload video</p>

    <p>i. Swivl application automatically uploads video to cloud</p>

    <p>ii. Video is scraped from Swivl cloud to TalkBack system</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Transcribe video</p>

    <p>i. Using automatic speech recognition, system transcribes audio</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Annotate transcript for “talk moves”</p>

    <p>i. Transcript is segmented into teacher-student turns.</p>

    <p>ii. Using a deep learning model, each turn is annotated for a talk move.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Compile statistics</p>

    <p>i. Count types of talk moves and save</p>

    <p>ii. Add similar category talk move frequencies and save</p>

    <p>iii. Update averages</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Present feedback through application</p>

    <p>i. Email teacher that video has been processed</p>

    <p>ii. Teacher views video and statistics through interface</p>
  </li>
</ol>
