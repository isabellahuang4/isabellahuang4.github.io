    <p>We designed two cultural probes for our project. 
Our project has two different dimensions: physical location and emotional location.
For the matter of physical location integrated with community, we thought asking our participants
to draw their own understanding of their physical community through a map
would elucidate their relationships with physical space and landmarks.
Furthermore, asking them to envision both their day and their friends’ days
as integrated within the sketch would conduct an exercise of situating
their experiences.</p>

<p>In re the second matter of emotional locations,
we designed an emotional mapping exercise, in which participants are asked to
locate their emotions within a non-descriptive chart.
Furthermore, they are asked to name the feeling and face and potentially
describe their emotions in detail.
Such an exercise has the aim of allowing the participants the space and time
to better understand their emotional geography throughout a day.
Moreover, it gives a better sense of what emotions are experienced and how
people relate to them.</p>
