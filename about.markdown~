This is my blog for the class CSCI 5839 User-Centered Design taught by Shaun Kane.
You will find reflection posts regarding class readings and class discussions.

I am a second-year PhD student at CU Boulder studying Cognitive Science and Computer Science.
My general research interests include embodied cognition, language, and education.
I am working with Tammy Sumner on the NSF funded TalkBack project, working to provide K12 mathematics teachers 
automatic feedback to better help facilitate equitable classroom dialogues.
