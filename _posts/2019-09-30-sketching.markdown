Location sharing for a meetup app:

I drew the interface I envisioned for a user selecting where on the map their home is. One would be able to drag and zoom through gestures and click on the home icon to select.

I envisioned two different ways one could code on an Apple TV. 
The first involved using Scratch and control through movement of the blocks.

The second involved using predictive text and a QWERTY keyboard.
