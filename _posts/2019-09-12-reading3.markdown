I first picked the paper by Oulasvirta et al. "Interaction in 4-second Bursts: the Fragmented Nature of Attentional Resource in Mobile HCI."
It sparked my interest, because I had previously taken a class called "Distraction," and have since been intrigued with regards to how our modes of attention and distraction are shaped by artefacts around us.
In the paper, Oulasvirta et al. propose a new theoretical framework (i.e. a theoretical contribution to the field) and empirically test the predictive validity of the framework through a field study.

Their Resource Competition Framework is useful in that it captures the complexity of what competes for a user's attentional resources in the modern, mobile world.
Moreover, this framework emphasizes the view that the social and cognitive are deeply intertwined,
which helps to advocate for an embodied and situated approach to understanding cognition and the user.

I also picked the paper by Gaver et al. "Design: Cultural probes," because the word "probe" seemed almost violent, 
like an exploitation of a misunderstood people through extraction and asking for free labour.
However, the packages of maps, postcards, photo albums, and media diaries were endearing. 
Indeed, the "probe" allowed the users to provide candid data on their own time, in a way that was exciting for the participants.
This "non-conventional" method for collecting data is interesting given its affordance of respect for the participant. 
It also allows for a different mode of engagement that is unique to these objects.
