On Monday as a small group, we discussed personas with respect to Google's Cardboard VR headset.
We approached the task through reverse-engineering, brainstorming different use cases that we knew of or that we could envision.
We did generate use cases that were pretty traditional for virtual reality in general, such as video games and sharing of experiences. 
However, we sought to focus on those that were particularly suited for Google Cardboard.

One of the use cases was in the classroom, for education.
We envisioned students using VR in the classroom in lessons that would benefit from different means of visualization, most notably in geometry classes.
The compelling reason to use a cardboard headset would be cost.
That is, cardboard is a cheap material and thus not too consequential in the hands of clumsy elementary school students.
Furthermore, to ensure equal participation, all students need access to a VR headset, requiring at least a handful of sets per classroom and thus a need to keep per item costs low.

Another use case we thought of was in the context of professional training.
While on the surface, training in virtual reality is simply more engaging than sitting through a seminar, 
there are compelling reasons that could commit an employer to utilize VR.
