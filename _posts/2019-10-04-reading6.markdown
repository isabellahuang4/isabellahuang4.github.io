It seems that Li et al's Topiary tool would be especially apt for use in our project, 
given that we are seeking to develop an app that puts location of self and others 
at the forefront.
It would afford us a Wizard of Oz tool to simulate location updates during user testing.
We could use data collected through the cultural probes (i.e. hand-drawn maps) 
to develop the back-end of Topiary. 

For the emotional mapping part of our project, prototyping could look many different ways.
I could envision us sketching different layouts and faces for emotion updating, also informed by our cultural probes (i.e. emotion chart).
To capture the interactivity and updating of emotions, we could add on to the Topiary system to include alerts and updates.
Wizard of Oz designs would be best to simulate other users' interactions that the tester is informed about.
