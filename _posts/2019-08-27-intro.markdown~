Hello! My name is Isabella Huang, and I use she/her/hers pronouns. I am a PhD student in Cognitive Science and Computer Science, working with Tammy Sumner. 


Here's a photo of me scarfing down a frozen burrito after day broke on an alpine start this summer. ![burrito](/assets/burrito.jpg)
And another photo of me further along the backpacking loop at Buckskin Pass, ecstatic after meeting Bucky the mountain goat. ![pass](/assets/headshot.jpg)
