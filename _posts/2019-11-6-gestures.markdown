Designing a Gesture-Driven Car

Our group decided to embark upon the (rather unsafe) idea of designing a car
that was entirely controlled by gestures and voice.
The steering was emulated by steering gestures (one or two handed).
Putting the car into gear used voice commands, such as 
"reverse" or "drive". 
Accelerating and braking was measured by the distance of the driver's heels
from the resting position. 
(i.e. to accelerate, slide right heel away from body)
To signal left or right turns, simply use the voice commands "left" and "right".
To honk, use the middle finger gesture! 

The trickiest part of designing the car was to make sure that 
actions were still natural (given the context of knowing how to drive a
traditional car) and comfortable. 
As an example, we realized that even with a physical steering wheel, 
drivers will often shift how they hold the wheel during a drive.
Thus, we decided that we can accept a myriad of steering gestures.
However, this limited how we can otherwise control the car, 
leaving us to design feet-centered gestures for accelerating and braking.

We did concede that a gesture-controlled car was inherently unsafe,
and proceeded without much consideration of those consequences.
