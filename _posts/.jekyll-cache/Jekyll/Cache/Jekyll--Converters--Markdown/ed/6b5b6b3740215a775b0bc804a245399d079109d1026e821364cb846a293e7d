  <li>This video is about 20 years old! Which ideas from this work show up in todayâ€™s shopping carts? Which ideas did not make it, and why didnâ€™t they?</li>
</ol>

<p>One idea that wasnâ€™t explicitly mentioned but showed up in their final design as well as todayâ€™s shopping carts is a rounder frame. Whether this is realized in plastic bumpers on the edges or the literal rounding of the metal frame, it is a design element geared towards safety that has persisted.
Another design element that I have seen less regularly but nonetheless still exists in the current world is the idea of a modular, removable shopping basket. It is not by any means standard, but it does acknowledge that there are times when pushing a cart is more convenient and when a smaller basket is required.</p>

<p>One element of IDEOâ€™s design that has not been fully realized is the roller-coaster-type seatbelt that turns into a push handle for the child seat in the cart. Aside from the nylon waist strap, there arenâ€™t more innovative solutions to the problem of securing your child inside the shopping cart. 
One reason that the seatbelt design could have failed to be taken up regards the ease of use â€“ the video did not show the users actually putting a child (or doll) into the seat and closing the handle down. 
It might not be that convenient to pull an over-the-shoulder bar over a squirming 1-year-old.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it might be the case that users changed their behaviour rather than appealed to design for better functionality. That is, shoppers may have just stopped taking their infants to the grocery store, removing that need.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Who did the design team talk to? For each group of stakeholders that the designers talked to, explain why is was important to talk to them.</li>
</ol>

<p>The two main groups of stakeholders the design team talked to were the owners of the grocery stores and the shoppers. The shoppers are the primary users of the product, and thus their perspective should be prioritized in designing the product. The owners of the stores are the buyers of the product, and thus their demands for the product, such as those centering on theft, are required to be represented within a successful design.</p>
