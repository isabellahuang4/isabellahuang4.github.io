Interviews and Focus Groups

Kane et al: At times avuncular and cantakerous, with the reflexes of a mongoose

In the introduction of the study, the authors note that the population interviewed for the study is small by nature of the method and thus poses a limitation for the conclusions drawn. 
However, they also note that this population itself is scarce – an incidence rate of ALS reported to be about one in 50,000. 
Moreover, the interviewees are predominantly male, which also reflects the patterns of the disease.
This tension is apparent in any work pursued in the context of underrepresented populations
where the question of how to best represent a community is fraught.

It is only slightly ironic that the method used to understand this population is through a medium (conversation) that they struggle with.

Bennett et al: How teens with visual impairments take, edit, and share photos on social media

After noticing many of my JEDI-minded friends on social media including descriptions of their image posts (especially on meme pages),
my interest was piqued with regards to how we can best make accessible the media we have deemed as a community to be note-worthy.

The simple act of going through one's personal social media feed or profile is deeply revealing,
not just of one's habits and interests but also of how that medium is situated within one's identity and how it shapes one's identity.
Such a tool – social media profile – allows one to tell their own curated story and serves as a powerful tool for understanding.
Interviewing through such an act seems to be deeply revealing and could be fruitful for other forms of research.
