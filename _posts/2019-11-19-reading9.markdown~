Organization and Visual Structure (Mullet and Sano)

In the discussion regarding balance, it is interesting that they juxtapose 
pieces of two different time periods and languages, 
as we know that style and design evolve over time and culture (figure 111).
Furthermore, the "assymetrically" balanced piece can be seen as balanced,
if one considers the rule of thirds.
Indeed, the focus is set at an intersection of thirds, using the principle
of lines and flow to make the piece engaging and attractive.
One could not argue that the contemporary piece is balanced without appealing
to white spce, which seems to be only tacitly referenced. 


Arranging Elements (Duarte)

I'm surprised that I never thought to use a Fibonacci column/grid before.
It is obvious that this would be appealing visual design layout, as
the naturalness of the Fibonacci spiral and patterns have been well established.
It also offers a departure from classic grid styles, offering
a breath of fresh air.
However, it is interesting to note the first example, of the layout, as
it doesn't quite adhere to the spiral grid.
The breaking of the spiral seems to throw the design slightly off-balance,
as now there is a smaller element upon which two larger elements either rest or abut.
Moreover, the text at the top seems cramped, and the white space at the bottom
is awkward and not used well. 
I wonder if there are more explicit rules to using the Fibonacci grid
than the simple plop and drop use of regular-sized grids.
As a side note, I would like to warn against the white-washing
of Zen Buddhism and Japanese flower arrangement 
and the "design principles" often appropriated from the 
religion and larger Japanese culture.

Information Visualization: Perception for Design (Chapter 5, Colin Ware)

In the discussion regarding preattentive processing, it is interesting to note
that the authors do not consider the studies showing the distinction
between serial and parallel processing. 
From my understanding, the differences in the search paradigms shown in 
Figure 5.11 seem to be able to be explained by the parallel versus serial 
search models.
Moreover, from my cognitive science perspective, most discussions of 
preattentive processing (which bears a starkly different name, e.g. early
filter versus late filter) come in the context of aural tasks.
It is interesting to see the medium shift!
